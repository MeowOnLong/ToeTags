title=Toe Tags
description=When your character dies, a Toe Tag is automatically generated and placed in their inventory.  If you read the toe tag it contains relevant information such as the date you died, the time you survived as well as your favorite weapon and kill count.
description=
description=The primary purpose here is to make it easier to identify your former characters from a pile of corpses. In multiplayer is also allows you to determine who the corpse belonged to.  For single player the "[i]Username[/i]" field in the toe tag details will seem pretty redundant.  However in multiplayer this will show the Steam Username of the account that was in control of this dead character.

description=Fully multiplayer compatible, 3d modeled and placeable in-world.
description=Tags have 0 weight to avoid conflicts adding them to inventories on death.

description=[h1]Optional Sub-Mod[/h1]
description=There is a sub-mod included called "[b]ToeTagsSorted[/b]".  If you enable this mod the name of the Toe Tags will change slightly.  By Default a toe tag's name is "[i]Toe Tag: John Smith[/i]".  However if you enable the Sorted variation it'll change the Toe Tag name to "[i][00420.69] John Smith[/i]" where the numbers are the hours the player survived.
description=
description=This makes it easier to determine which of your characters lived the longest when sorting through a collection of toe tags.  It must be enabled at the time of death to have the toe tag generated with the hour title, it will not retroactively update old tags with the new labels.

description=[h1]Known Issue with Dates[/h1]
description=For some reason or another the watches in game always show the date is one day ahead of what the game engine says.  So for example, when you die, we ask the game engine what the date is.  It replies back with "[i]July 09[/i]" for example.  As far as the simulation is concerned it is Fri Jul 09 at 11:14:19 EDT in 1993 BUT your watch in the user interface says "[i]July 10[/i]".
description=
description=No matter how you go about querying the date ([i]linux timestamps, flat text strings, start date + hours survived, etc[/i]) the engine always reports the same and the clock is always 1 day ahead.  I've come to the conclusion that the watch is actually incorrectly programmed.
description=
description=As such, your toe tags will appear to be 1 day behind the watch.  It's pretty minor as your Survived time is still accurate, it's just the date that is one day off on display.
